    Hi, I am Ian, and I started to work with computers in 6th grade when I
    joined the robotics club at my school. Three years later I joined the
    robotics club of my high school as a programmer. We participated in
    competitions which took place in the Turkish Capital of Ankara. Later in my
    junior year, I came to Canada and started my own robotics club there. It was
    a very challenging environment as I was new to Canada, I had to speak in
    English and I was responsible for designing the robot as well as programming
    it. Yet, in those conditions, I persevered. My passion for computer science
    only increased since then. Now, as a software engineering student, I am
    feeling more excited than ever before because of getting so close to joining
    the workforce which I dreamt of since I was a child.
