      Hi, I am Ian, and I started to work with computers in 6th grade when I
      joined the robotics club at my school. Three years later I joined the
      robotics club of my high school as a programmer. We participated in
      competitions which took place in the Turkish Capital of Ankara. Later in
      my junior year, I came to Canada and started my own robotics club there.
      It was a very challenging environment as I was new to Canada, I had to
      speak in English and I was responsible for designing the robot as well as
      programming it. Yet, in those conditions, I persevered. My passion for
      computer science only increased since then. Now, as a software engineering
      student, I am feeling more excited than ever before because of getting so
      close to joining the workforce which I dreamt of since I was a child.
