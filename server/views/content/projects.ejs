<!--projects introduction-->
<p>
  I love programming and engineering. Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, I had
  a lot of free time to spend on projects while stuck at home. These projects
  are how I spent my 1 year in quarantine.

    <h2>www.pknsl.com</h2>
    <p>
      I made this website as a hobby in June 2020. I use it for blogging,
      e-commerce and also host family archives in a subdomain for my family
      members to easily access.

    <h2>e.centennial Homepage Simplifier</h2>
    <p>
      Last semester our e.centennial website was bloated with too many
      disclaimers and banners. I found it annoying and distracting so I coded
      this Google Chrome extension to remove anything above the course content
      for easier access. You can find it on the Chrome store.

    <h2>Custom Laptop Lid</h2>
    <p>
      I did several small projects during the pandemic. Apart from decorating
      the house and tinkering with small laptops; my most proud is customizing
      my main laptop’s lid.
